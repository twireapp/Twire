## [Here Be Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons)

Pocket Plays started as an Android learning project on my first semester of Computer Science. 
This means that quite a bit of the program has high coupling, low coherence and generally poorly written and structured code.  
This will surely impact the way you navigate, understand and maybe contribute to the project. 

I've done my best to rewrite the worst parts before making Pocket Plays open source.

## Contributing

### Issues

Like any other project, some bugs are sure to be found, so it 
goes a long way if people document and submit bugs and other
issues to the GitHub issue tracker, to make sure they get squashed.
